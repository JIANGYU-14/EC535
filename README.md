# Radar System - Embedded System

This project is a real-time object detection radar system. We implemented an ultrasonic sensor which supported by a servo motor to detect surrounding objects and calculating the distance from the object based on the duration between the rising edge and the falling edge of high level sensor response. We also set a servo motor to keep sweeping at a speed of 30 degree per second and use a LCD screen to display numerical angle and distance data in a radar-like figures.
