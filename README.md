# Radar System - Embedded System

This project is a real-time object detection radar system. We implemented an ultrasonic sensor which supported by a servo motor to detect surrounding objects and calculating the distance from the object based on the duration between the rising edge and the falling edge of high level sensor response. We also set a servo motor to keep sweeping at a speed of 30 degree per second and use a LCD screen to display numerical angle and distance data in a radar-like figures. 

In the first section of the report, we describe the motivation of our project and the importance of what we learned during this project. We appreciated the experience of practicing what we learned from lectures and labs and we are all interested in further study of object detection(recognition) with embedded system.

Additionally, we also talk about the implementation details of every component, the challenges we conquered and also some potential features we might to achieve in the future.
